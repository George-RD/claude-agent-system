# Claude Code Autonomous Development Environment

Complete autonomous development environment using Claude Code with specialized agents, commands, and safe development containers.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Autonomous Mode)

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo>
   cd claude-config
   code .  # VS Code will prompt to open in dev container
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code**
   ```bash
   claude-code
   ```

3. **Initialize Project**
   ```
   /init
   ```

4. **Provide Requirements**
   ```
   Build a REST API for task management with authentication, 
   CRUD operations, input validation, and comprehensive tests
   ```

5. **Claude Code Delivers**
   - Automatically analyzes requirements
   - Uses agent pipeline for systematic development
   - Delivers tested, production-ready code

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```
.devcontainer/         # Safe development environment with firewall
agents/                # Specialized agents (architect, debugger, developer, etc.)
commands/              # Commands like plan-execution
scripts/               # Automation scripts including /init
prompt-engineering.md  # Prompt optimization techniques
CLAUDE.md             # Project memory and configuration
```

## ü§ñ Agent System

### Multi-Agent Pipeline
Claude Code uses a sophisticated multi-agent approach for autonomous development:

```
Requirements ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Debugger ‚Üí Quality Reviewer ‚Üí Technical Writer
```

### Available Agents
- **üèóÔ∏è Architect** (`@agent-architect`): Analyzes requirements and designs technical solutions
- **üë®‚Äçüíª Developer** (`@agent-developer`): Implements code with comprehensive testing
- **üêõ Debugger** (`@agent-debugger`): Investigates issues and performs root cause analysis
- **‚úÖ Quality Reviewer** (`@agent-quality-reviewer`): Reviews code quality and security
- **üìù Technical Writer** (`@agent-technical-writer`): Creates documentation and explanations

### Autonomous Workflow
1. **Analysis Phase**: Architect analyzes requirements and creates technical design
2. **Implementation Phase**: Developer implements code following design specifications
3. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage requirement
4. **Debugging Phase**: If issues arise, debugger investigates systematically
5. **Quality Phase**: Quality reviewer ensures code meets production standards
6. **Documentation Phase**: Technical writer creates comprehensive documentation

## üîí Safe Development Environment

### DevContainer Features
- **Isolated Environment**: Containerized development with proper firewall rules
- **Permission Management**: Non-root user with restricted, safe permissions
- **Network Controls**: Controlled network access for development safety
- **Tool Integration**: Pre-configured with Claude Code CLI and development tools

### Security Features
- Development container runs with `dangerously-skip-permissions` safely
- Firewall rules restrict network access appropriately
- Volume mounts for persistent configuration without security risks
- User permissions limited to development needs only

## üéØ Quality Gates

Every autonomous development cycle includes mandatory quality gates:

- **‚úÖ Zero Linting Violations**: Code must pass all project linters
- **‚úÖ 100% Test Pass Rate**: All existing tests must continue passing
- **‚úÖ >80% Test Coverage**: New code must be well-tested
- **‚úÖ Performance Baseline**: Within 5% of performance baseline
- **‚úÖ Security Review**: All security considerations addressed
- **‚úÖ Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for public APIs

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Usage

### Direct Agent Access
You can manually delegate to specific agents:
```bash
@agent-architect "Design a caching layer for high-performance API"
@agent-developer "Implement the Redis caching layer with connection pooling"
@agent-debugger "Investigate why cache hit rate is lower than expected"
@agent-quality-reviewer "Review the caching implementation for security issues"
@agent-technical-writer "Document the caching layer API and usage examples"
```

### Command System
- `/init` - Initialize project for autonomous development
- `@commands/plan-execution.md` - Execute systematic development plans

## üìö Advanced Features

### Memory Management
- **Project Memory**: Automatic loading of CLAUDE.md configuration
- **Agent Memory**: Each agent has specialized knowledge and patterns
- **Prompt Engineering**: Advanced techniques from `prompt-engineering.md`

### Workflow Automation
- **Extended Thinking**: Deep reasoning for complex architectural decisions
- **Resume/Continue**: Pick up where you left off with full context
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: Use as build system component for automated code review

## üé¨ Example Workflows

### Full-Stack Web Application
```
"Build a full-stack todo application with React frontend, 
Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, JWT authentication, 
real-time updates via WebSocket, and comprehensive test suite"
```

### API Development
```
"Create a RESTful API for inventory management with OpenAPI docs, 
input validation, rate limiting, audit logging, and Docker deployment"
```

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
"Implement a data processing pipeline that reads CSV files, 
validates data, transforms it using business rules, 
and outputs to multiple formats with error handling"
```

## üîß Configuration

### Project-Specific Setup
After running `/init`, your CLAUDE.md will be enhanced with:
- Detected technology stack and build tools
- Project-specific coding conventions
- Testing strategies and coverage requirements
- Error handling patterns for your stack
- Performance and security considerations

### Custom Agent Instructions
You can customize agent behavior for your specific project needs in CLAUDE.md.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Container Issues
```bash
# Rebuild development container
Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
```

### Permission Issues
The development container is configured to run safely with restricted permissions. If you encounter permission issues, they're likely intentional security boundaries.

### Agent Communication
If agents seem unresponsive, ensure:
- CLAUDE.md is properly configured
- All agent files are present in `agents/` directory
- Claude Code has loaded the project configuration

## üôè Acknowledgments

`prompt-engineering.md` is extracted from [Southbridge Research's exceptional analysis of Claude Code prompts](https://southbridge-research.notion.site/Prompt-Engineering-The-Art-of-Instructing-AI-2055fec70db181369002dcdea7d9e732). This document has been invaluable for understanding and applying advanced prompt engineering techniques.

The devcontainer configuration is adapted from the official [Anthropic Claude Code repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) to provide a safe development environment with proper security boundaries.
